# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-IN-XGBOOST-ALGORITHM
  This Project is focused on credit card fraud detection in real world scenarios. Nowadays credit card frauds are drastically increasing in number as compared to earlier times. Criminals are using fake identity and various technologies to trap the users and get the money out of them. Therefore, it is very essential to find a solution to these types of frauds. The result is indicated concerning the best accuracy for XGBoost Algorithm are unit 99% respectively.

**XGBOOST ALGORITHM**
  The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular and efficient open-source implementation of the gradient boosted trees algorithm. Gradient boosting is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models. The XGBoost algorithm performs well in machine learning competitions because of its robust handling of a variety of data types, relationships, distributions, and the variety of hyperparameters that you can fine-tune. 
 XGBoost was created by Tianqi Chen and initially maintained by the Distributed (Deep) Machine Learning Community (DMLC) group. It is the most common algorithm used for applied machine learning in competitions and has gained popularity through winning solutions in structured and tabular data.

**CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION TECHNIQUE**
 
 The credit card fraud detection techniques are classified in two general categories: fraud analysis (misuse detection) and user behavior analysis (anomaly detection). The first group of techniques deals with supervised classification tasks at the transaction level. In these methods, transactions are labeled as fraudulent or normal based on previous historical data. This dataset is then used to create classification models which can predict the state (normal or fraud) of new records. There are numerous model creation methods for a typical class classification task such as rule induction, decision trees and random forest as well as XGBoost Algorithm. This approach is proven to reliably detect most fraud tricks which have been observed before, also known as misuse detection. The second approach deals with unsupervised methodologies which are based on account behavior. In this method a transaction is detected as fraudulent if it is in contrast with the user’s normal behavior. This is because we don’t expect fraudsters behave the same as the account owner or be aware of the behavior model of the owner. To this aim, we need to extract the legitimate user behavioral model (eg. user profile) for each account and then detect fraudulent activities according to it. Comparing New behaviors with this model, different enough activities are distinguished as frauds. The profiles may contain the activity information of the account; such as merchant types, amount, location and time of transactions. This method is also known as anomaly detection. It is important to highlight the key differences between user behavior analysis and fraud analysis approaches.The Fraud analysis method can detect known fraud tricks, with a low false positive rate. These systems extract the signature and model of fraud tricks presented in oracle dataset and can then easily determine exactly which frauds, the system is currently experiencing. If the test data does not contain any fraud signatures, no alarm is raised. Thus, the false positive rate can be reduced extremely. However, since learning of a fraud analysis system (i.e. classifier) is based on limited and specific fraud records. It cannot detect novel frauds. As a result, the false negative rate may be extremely high depending on how ingenious the fraudsters. These Methods do not search for specific fraud patterns, but rather compare incoming activities with the constructed model of legitimate user behavior. Any activity that is sufficiently different from the model will be considered as a possible fraud. Though user behavior analysis approaches are powerful in detecting innovative frauds, they really suffer from high rates of false alarm. Moreover, if a fraud occurs during the training phase, this fraudulent behavior will be entered in baseline mode and is assumed to be normal in further analysis. In this section we will briefly introduce some current fraud detection techniques which are applied to credit card fraud detection tasks.
