ABSTRACT:
This Project is focused on credit card fraud detection in real world scenarios.
Nowadays credit card frauds are drastically increasing in number as compared to
earlier times. Criminals are using fake identity and various technologies to trap
the users and get the money out of them. Therefore, it is very essential to find a
solution to these types of frauds. In this proposed project we designed a model to
detect the fraud activity in credit card transactions. This system can provide most
of the important features required to detect illegal and illicit transactions. As
technology changes constantly, it is becoming difficult to track the behavior and
pattern of criminal transactions. To come up with the solution one can make use
of technologies with the increase of machine learning, artificial intelligence and
other relevant fields of information technology; it becomes feasible to automate
this process and to save some of the intensive amounts of labor that is put into
detecting credit card fraud. Initially, we will collect the credit card usage data-set
by users and classify it as trained and testing dataset using a XGBoost Algorithm.
Using this feasible algorithm, we can analyze the larger data-set and user
provided current data-set. Then augment the accuracy of the result data.
Proceeded with the application of processing of some of the attributes provided
which can find affected fraud detection in viewing the graphical model of data
visualization. The performance of the techniques is gauged based on accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity, precision. The result is indicated concerning the best
accuracy for XGBoost Algorithm are unit 99% respectively.
